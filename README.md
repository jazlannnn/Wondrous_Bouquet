# Wondrous Bouquet Online Fragrance Store System

Project Overview: During my 4th semester of Diploma, my team and I developed the Wondrous Bouquet, an online fragrance store system. This web-based application aimed to enhance the 
shopping experience for customers seeking high-quality fragrances. The project focused on improving inventory management, streamlining the order process, 
and efficiently tracking customer information. By utilizing PHP for backend functionality, JavaScript for interactivity, and MySQL via XAMPP for database management, 
the system was designed to optimize business operations and improve customer satisfaction in the online fragrance market.
