# Wondrous Bouquet Online Fragrance Store System

Project Overview: During my 4th semester of Diploma, my team and I developed the Wondrous Bouquet, an online fragrance store system. This web-based application aimed to enhance the 
shopping experience for customers seeking high-quality fragrances. The project focused on improving inventory management, streamlining the order process, 
and efficiently tracking customer information. By utilizing PHP for backend functionality, JavaScript for interactivity, and MySQL via XAMPP for database management, 
the system was designed to optimize business operations and improve customer satisfaction in the online fragrance market.

Technologies Used: PHP, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, MySQL, XAMPP, phpMyAdmin

Key Features and Achievements

Product and Inventory Management: Developed a system to manage fragrance listings, enabling easy updates to pricing and stock levels.

Customer Information Tracking: Implemented features to capture and store customer data, enhancing personalized marketing and user engagement.

Order Management: Streamlined the order processing workflow, tracking orders from placement to delivery with real-time updates.

Database Integration: Utilized XAMPP and phpMyAdmin for effective management and hosting of the MySQL database.

User-Friendly Interface: Designed an intuitive web interface using CSS and JavaScript for an engaging shopping experience.
